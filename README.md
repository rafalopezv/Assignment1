###Introduction

This is the repository for the first assignment of the course 
In order to fulfill our first task, we created two separated Rscript files to analyse two data sets already present in R. This file describes all the steps of our work.

###Characteristics of the first assignment

According to the <a href="https://github.com/rafalopezv/SyllabusAndLectures">Syllabus</a> : Understanding file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics. Creation a fully documented GitHub repository, including  a descriptive README.md file. 
"The repository will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. Deadline 4 March, 10% of final grade." 

### Women data set analysed by Emilia Sicari
After listing of the data sets provided by R, I chose the one called "Women", which describes the height and weight of American women aged 30-39 in 1975.The data set is composed only of two numeric variables: height and weight. Therefore, I proceeded by applying descriptive statistics to the two variable separately and then I ended up assessing the correlation between the two variables. You can find the analysis I carried out in the folder Assignement1 in the file named DataSet1.R.

### The Worlds´ Telephones analysed by Rafael Lopez V
The number of telephones in various regions of the world (in thousands) is expressed in the years:1951, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961.All the data is also classified in 7 regions: North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Oceania, Africa, Central America.
The initial matrix of 7 rows (years) and 8 columns (Regions) was modified in a data base format.The file of the anañysis is: DataSet2.

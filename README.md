This is an Readme File for the first assignment of the course: introduction to collaboratiuve social science data analysis. 
In order to fulfill our first task, we created two separated Rscript files to analysed two of data sets already present in R. This file describes all the steps of our work.

### Women data set analysed by Emilia Sicari
After listing of the data sets provided by R, I chose the one called "Women", which describes the height and weight of American women aged 30-39 in 1975.The data set is composed only of two numeric variables: height and weight. Therefore, I proceeded by applying descriptive statistics to the two variable separately and then I ended up assessing the correlation between the two variables. You can find the analysis I carried out in the folder Assignement1 in the file named DataSet1.R.
